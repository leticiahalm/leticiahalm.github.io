            <h2 id="headerAboutMe">About Me.</h2>
            <p>I'm a computer science student based in Berlin, Germany, with a passion for programming. I am currently studying International Media and Computing at the HTW: University for Applied Sciences Berlin, Germany.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I like to read many different kinds of books. I also enjoy photography and drawing; that's where I can live out my creativity.</p>
            <p><br><br></p>
            <h3 id="headerMyJourney">My Journey.</h3>
            <p>I graduated from High school in 2023 with some knowledge in HTML and CSS. Additionally, I have gotten some experience from internships in Media and Design, which I enjoyed a lot.</p>
            <p>Because of that, I decided to study Media and Computing in Berlin. Currently, I am learning Java at the University and I also took a course in Web development, where I learned more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>I am also currently teaching myself to use Blender. You can see some finished stuff in the project section.</p>
